## **MY LATEST PROJECTS**
## [Project 1: House Pricing Analysis in Canada](pythoncode/HousePricing.html)

- Created a python code using Jupiter lab in Anaconda Navigator to analyze the fluctuations in the price of houses in a Canadian neighborhood based on various attributes.
- Collected data from Canada housing website for analysis.
- Gathered key insights to identify patterns which attribute to the high and low cost of houses.
- This would help prospective clients looking to buy a house in Canada. 



##  [Project 2: Predictive Modeling approach to improve compressive strength of concrete](pythoncode/Cement.html)

- Created a Python code using Jupiter lab to develop a Multivariate Linear Regression Algorithm script to predict Concrete compressive strength (CMS).
- Derived useful insights with respect to concrete metrics and created efficient models to predict the value of CMS.
- This will help to understand the ratio of raw materials to be used for producing high quality cement with good strength.



## [Project 3: Prediction of probability of death among heart patients](pythoncode/Death_Event.html)

- Developed a logistic regression model to classify the deceased and alive patients during the follow-up period with an accuracy of 80%.
- The data worked upon was collected from the Centre for Disease Control (CDC).
- Provided recommendations to improve the model which can help doctors to better classify the death event among heart patients.


## [Project 4: Data analysis of crime rates across different provinces in Canada](pythoncode/Project4_CrimeRateAnalysis.docx)

- Used Microsoft Power BI to create professional visualizations that help the RCMP (federal police) to understand crime rate distribution.
- Crime Data across different provinces was imported from Statistics Canada.
- Enabled future predictions of crime rate for next year for Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec provinces.
