#Project 1: House Pricing Analysis in Canada
Created a python code using Jupiter lab in Anaconda Navigator to analyze the fluctuations in the price of houses in a Canadian neighborhood based on various attributes.
Collected data from Canada housing website for analysis.
Gathered key insights to identify patterns which attribute to the high and low cost of houses.
This would help prospective clients looking to buy a house in Canada.

#Project 2: Predictive Modeling approach to improve compressive strength of concrete
Created a Python code using Jupiter lab to develop a Multivariate Linear Regression Algorithm script to predict Concrete compressive strength (CMS).
Derived useful insights with respect to concrete metrics and created efficient models to predict the value of CMS.
This will help to understand the ratio of raw materials to be used for producing high quality cement with good strength.

#Project 3: Prediction of probability of death among heart patients
Developed a logistic regression model to classify the deceased and alive patients during the follow-up period with an accuracy of 80%.
The data worked upon was collected from the Centre for Disease Control (CDC).
Provided recommendations to improve the model which can help doctors to better classify the death event among heart patients.

#Project 4: Data analysis of crime rates across different provinces in Canada
Used Microsoft Power BI to create professional visualizations that help the RCMP (federal police) to understand crime rate distribution.
Crime Data across different provinces was imported from Statistics Canada.
Enabled future predictions of crime rate for next year for Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec provinces.
